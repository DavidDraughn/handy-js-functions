What is this
=========
****
This is just a set of useful functions which are more or less trivial. I continue to update the repository with the functions that I wrote while working on any of my projects, but I hope, they might be useful for others.

How to use?
===
****
All the functions are categorized in their respective filex e.g. all the dates related functions are inside date.js, dom related functions are inside dom.js and so on.

Any docs?
===
****
All the functions are commented, just look inside
